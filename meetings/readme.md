# O3DE Security SIG - Meetings

## Meetings

Each SIG hosts a regular community meeting to update the community about the progress of the project and the SIG's contribution to the project. It is a recurring event to give everyone a chance to have their voice heard.

The SIG holds its meetings every two weeks on Wednesday (See [O3DE Calendar](https://lists.o3de.org/g/o3de-calendar) for next meeting). Future meetings are held based on the [agendas on GitHub](https://github.com/o3de/sig-security/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amtg-agenda).

Please [reach out on Discord](https://discord.gg/p3padwr58u) or [Sign up on the Mailing Lists](https://lists.o3de.org/groups) to get notifications for the recurring events.

## Who can Attend

O3DE cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. *You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the project.* The #sig-security channel on [O3DE Discord](https://discord.gg/FDA3s4FBD2) is a great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the [GitHub Discussions area](https://github.com/o3de/sig-security/discussions) which need your input.

## Agenda Items

You can find a link to the proposed agenda for the next meeting as [an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/o3de/sig-security/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amtg-agenda) under the O3DE [SIG-Security](https://github.com/o3de/sig-security/) repro.

Please feel free to propose any of your topics, thoughts, or areas you feel are important to discuss.
